Java Design Patterns Demonstration
A comprehensive demonstration of 6 essential design patterns in Java, showcasing best practices in object-oriented programming and software architecture.
ðŸ“‹ Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of three categories of design patterns:

Behavioral Patterns: Observer, Command
Creational Patterns: Factory, Builder
Structural Patterns: Adapter, Decorator

ðŸŽ¯ Design Patterns Included
1. Observer Pattern (Behavioral)
Use Case: News Agency System

Implements a publish-subscribe model
Multiple news channels subscribe to a news agency
Automatic notification when news is published
Thread-safe observer management

2. Command Pattern (Behavioral)
Use Case: Smart Home Control System

Encapsulates requests as objects
Supports undo/redo operations
Command history tracking
Decouples invoker from receiver

3. Factory Pattern (Creational)
Use Case: Vehicle Manufacturing System

Creates objects without specifying exact classes
Supports Car, Motorcycle, and Truck creation
Centralized object creation logic
Input validation for model and year

4. Builder Pattern (Creational)
Use Case: Computer Configuration System

Constructs complex objects step by step
Fluent interface for easy configuration
Separates construction from representation
Supports method chaining

5. Adapter Pattern (Structural)
Use Case: Payment Processing System

Converts PayPal API to standard payment interface
Makes incompatible interfaces work together
Wraps third-party libraries seamlessly
Transaction ID tracking

6. Decorator Pattern (Structural)
Use Case: Coffee Shop System

Adds functionality dynamically to objects
Extends beverage with condiments (Mocha, etc.)
Maintains single responsibility principle
Calculates cumulative costs
